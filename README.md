## EXPERIENCE
+ Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI): I Conducted a comprehensive revenue analysis for a telecommunications client using Power BI. Investigated call center performance, customer tenure, and predict churn. I Built interactive dashboards with DAX metrics to track at-risk customers and evaluate service quality.
+ Automotive Inventory Analysis (Excel): I Used Microsoft Excel to manage and analyze automotive inventory data. Applied formulas, pivot tables, and conditional formatting to identify inventory trends and vehicle performance. Improved decision-making through clean and structured reporting.
+ Sales and Budget Data Modeling (Power BI): I Designed a star schema model using FactSales and FactBudgets tables. Created supporting dimension tables (Product, Customer, Geography, Date, Category Segment). Focused on Power Query transformations (promoted headings, removed duplicates, data type changes, split columns) to prepare data for scalable analysis - without a visualization layer.
